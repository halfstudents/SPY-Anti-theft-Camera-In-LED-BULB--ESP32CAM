Hi guys, Today we are going to make a SPY camera using ESP32-CAM. I have some ideas to install that camera in a Led bulb cover or phone charger. Because some of the products related to this is also available on amazon. But I want to see the data over Wi-Fi or Internet. And that make sense, If we are using a non-Wi-Fi camera in this century without IOT, then our generation is way behind.
So, In this tutorial We will discuss the ESP32 cam boards in brief. Then, how to program them and how to make connection between camera module and wi-fi, some sort of coding knowledge. And finally, we will install whole setup into a Led BULB. And then we order the PCB prototypes of power supply from JLCPCB (5pcs in just $2).

Updates:
In next tutorials we will learn, how to stream over internet. So that we can access our system from anywhere. May be blink IoT will be the solution. So please stay tuned for that. If you are new to my articles then follow us on Hackster, Hackaday and Instructables.
